# Main idea
ActivityPlanner is a web application that can be used in two account modes - coach and athlete. The difference is that the coach has access to additional feature like quote of the day or a page listing articles. Tha main idea is that users can create their own workout schedule, keep track of their achievements and goals (for example what is their water intake) and see graphs for their goals.
